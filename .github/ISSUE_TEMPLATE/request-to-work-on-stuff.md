### Describe what you'd like to do

Give us an idea of the idea, as it were...

### Describe why you can do it

A brief description of what expertise you bring to working on this. Examples are helpful (and fun!)

### Outline the plan

Some

*   bullet
*   points

outlining the tasks in the proposed scope.

Sky's the limit; any initiative will be appreciated (even if not accepted) and we'd LOVE help... even if it's just... *sigh* ... tacos. (vegetarian preferred, but we know a guy who'll take carnitas off our hands NQA...) ((also, wouldn't mind if you figured out who keeps letting these dang ellipseseses in here...))
